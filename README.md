# Credit Risk Assessment

In this project, I have performed credit risk analysis and developed a classification model using the XGBoost algorithm to predict the chances of defaulting of a loan borrower. The dataset for this project was taken from Kaggle, and kt contains mutliple factors involved in loans and the verdict of whether the borrower defaulted on his loan.
